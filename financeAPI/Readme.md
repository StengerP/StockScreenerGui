# Python package to collect financial metrics and ratios data
## Dr. Tirthajyoti Sarkar, Fremont, CA, June 2020

We wrote a simple Python class script for interfacing with a [financial data microservice](https://financialmodelingprep.com/).

You can pull data about and build a Pandas DataFrame with almost all important financial metrics and ratios by invoking a simple method.

We also provide simple charting methods (bar chart and scatter plots) for analyzing the data graphically.

Note that you need to obtain your own secret API key (free) from the website and register it after instantiating the class object.
